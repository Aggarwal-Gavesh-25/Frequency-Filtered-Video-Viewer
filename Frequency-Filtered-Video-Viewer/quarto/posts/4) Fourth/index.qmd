1-3 :- This while loop iterates over each frame of the video. cap.read() reads the next frame from the video, and ret is a boolean value indicating whether the frame was successfully read.

4-8 :- Here, an array filtered_frame is created to store the filtered image. The loop iterates over each color channel (assuming BGR), flattens the channel to 1D, filters the frequency components using the filter_frequency function, reshapes the filtered channel back to the original shape, and assigns it to filtered_frame.

9-10 :- The filtered image is normalized to the 0-255 range and converted to the uint8 data type, which is expected by cv2.imshow().

11-12 :- Both the original and filtered frames are displayed using cv2.imshow().

13-14 :- This line waits for a key press for 25 milliseconds. If the pressed key is 'q', the loop breaks, and the program ends.

15-16 :- If ret is False, indicating that there are no more frames to read, the loop breaks, and the program ends.
